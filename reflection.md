Objective:
The objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with Python programming by working with files, lists, and designing/implementing functions. The goal was to develop a program that allows users to analyze headlines from text files, perform specific operations like word search, average character calculations, and write to files. This lab aimed to improve my understanding of file handling, function design, and efficient problem-solving techniques.

Procedure
To solve the problem, I started by identifying the user options and breaking the problem into smaller tasks. I wrote the functions for each user option separately and tested them individually to ensure they worked correctly before integrating them into the main program. For example, I created functions for counting headlines with a specific word, calculating averages, and finding the longest and shortest headlines. The main function was designed to tie everything together, providing the user with a menu-driven interface. Key concepts explored included for-loops, string operations, and error handling to ensure user-friendly interactions.

Results:
The results exceeded my expectations. The program worked efficiently and provided accurate outputs for the user options. While I didnâ€™t test extreme edge cases, proper error handling ensured the program handled invalid inputs gracefully. For example, invalid file names or incorrect menu options did not crash the program but instead prompted the user to try again.

Reflection:
The most challenging part was creating and debugging the functions, especially ensuring the for-loops behaved as intended. Reviewing course materials and notes helped overcome these challenges. Following the three programming rules, I kept the code as simple and modular as possible, but the complexity of the problem made it a mentally taxing task. Working alone added to the difficulty, but it taught me perseverance. This project was a true test of patience and problem-solving skills, and while difficult, it was incredibly rewarding. I learned to tackle problems step-by-step and not give up when faced with challenges.
